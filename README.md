# IMS_KIRANE
This project targets the Kirana stores that we all buy our regular groceries and general commodities from.  
Paper and Pen is long gone and the times are changing. We need a product which is as fast as a human mind in managing this fast business. It is general knowledge that this is a fast moving store where things should happen quickly in demanding times. Our Inventory Management System integrates into the daily working of a Kirana store operator providing him a single, User-friendly, enticing interface handling all the products stored and their prices, updating him on the short of stock, expiry dates, quantities remaining, and at the end of the day giving him analytics of the performance of their store.  
We intend to tap into this market and make a change.
